# PROC_MONITOR - README
## Overview

PROC_MONITOR is a simple command-line tool that lets you monitor processes running on your Linux system. It displays key details like the process name, ID, parent process ID, user, state, memory usage, and CPU usage in real-time.
Features

    Real-Time Updates: The process list refreshes every second.
    Detailed Information: Shows the essential details for each process, including memory and CPU usage.

How It Works

The app reads information from the /proc directory, which contains data on all running processes in Linux. It calculates the CPU usage of each process over a one-second period and displays this information in a table format.

    Linux system

Running the App

    Install the necessary Python packages:

    bash

pip install textual rich
